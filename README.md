<h1>Codewars Challenges</h1>

<h2>Description:</h2>
This is where I attempt to solve the challenges from Codewars.

<h2>Javascript</h2>

<h3>Count positive numbers and the sum of negative numbers</h3>

* This challenge can be found in the file countPositiveSumNegatives.js

<h3>Convert boolean values to String 'yes' or 'no'</h3>
Complete the method that takes a boolean value and return a 'Yes' string for true, or a 'No' string for false.

* This challenge can be found in the file convertBooleanToStrings.js

<h3>Find the smallest integer in the array</h3>
Given an array of integers your solution should find the smallest integer.

For example:

Given [34, 15, 88, 2] your solution will return 2
Given [34, -345, -1, 100] your solution will return -345
You can assume, for the purpose of this kata, that the supplied array will not be empty.

* This challenge can be found in the file smallestIntegerInArray.js

<h3>Is n divisible by x and y?</h3>
Create a function isDivisible(n, x, y) that checks if a number n is divisible by two numbers x AND y. All inputs are positive, non-zero digits.

For example:

isDivisible(3,1,3)--> true because 3 is divisible by 1 and 3
isDivisible(12,2,6)--> true because 12 is divisible by 2 and 6
isDivisible(100,5,3)--> false because 100 is not divisible by 3
isDivisible(12,7,5)--> false because 12 is neither divisible by 7 nor 5

* This challenge can be found in the file isDivisibleBy.js
