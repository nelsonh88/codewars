<h1>Codewars Challenges</h1>

<h2>Description:</h2>

<p>This is where I attempt to solve the challenges from Codewars.</p>

<h2>Javascript Challenges</h2>

<h3>Count positive numbers and the sum of negative numbers</h3>

* This challenge can be found in the file countPositiveSumNegatives.js

<h3>Convert boolean values to String 'yes' or 'no'</h3>
<p>Complete the method that takes a boolean value and return a 'Yes' string for true, or a 'No' string for false.</p>

* This challenge can be found in the file convertBooleanToStrings.js

<h3>Find the smallest integer in the array</h3>
<p>Given an array of integers your solution should find the smallest integer.</p>

<p>For example:
Given [34, 15, 88, 2] your solution will return 2
Given [34, -345, -1, 100] your solution will return -345
You can assume, for the purpose of this kata, that the supplied array will not be empty.</p>

* This challenge can be found in the file smallestIntegerInArray.js

<h3>Is n divisible by x and y?</h3>
<p>Create a function isDivisible(n, x, y) that checks if a number n is divisible by two numbers x AND y. All inputs are positive, non-zero digits.</p>

<p>For example:
isDivisible(3,1,3)--> true because 3 is divisible by 1 and 3
isDivisible(12,2,6)--> true because 12 is divisible by 2 and 6
isDivisible(100,5,3)--> false because 100 is not divisible by 3
isDivisible(12,7,5)--> false because 12 is neither divisible by 7 nor 5</p>

* This challenge can be found in the file isDivisibleBy.js

<h3>Rock Paper Scissors</h3>
<p>Let's play! You have to return which player won! In case of a draw return Draw!.</p>

<p>For example:
rps('scissors','paper') // Player 1 won!
rps('scissors','rock') // Player 2 won!
rps('paper','paper') // Draw!</p>

* This challenge can be found in the file rps.js
