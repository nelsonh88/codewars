<h1>Codewars Challenges</h1>

<h2>Description:</h2>
This is where I attempt to solve the challenges from Codewars.

<h2>Javascript</h2>

<h3>Count Positive Numbers and the Sum of Negative Numbers</h3>

<h3>Convert Boolean Values to String 'Yes' or 'No'</h3>
Complete the method that takes a boolean value and return a 'Yes' string for true, or a 'No' string for false.

<h3>Find the Smallest Integer in the Array</h3>
Given an array of integers your solution should find the smallest integer.

For example:

Given [34, 15, 88, 2] your solution will return 2
Given [34, -345, -1, 100] your solution will return -345
You can assume, for the purpose of this kata, that the supplied array will not be empty.
